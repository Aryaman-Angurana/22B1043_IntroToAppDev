In this, apart from the things said explicitly, there is:

1. An edit button to edit your data

2. a date provision

3. Sorting of the data with respect to the dates provided

Also, I have stored data to an array in firebase database, which removes repeated entries..... but in this, you can give repeated entries because a unique id is associated with each data entry, which is generated randomly.
